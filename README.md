Stimulation-Simulator-2015
==========================

By Andrew, Bradley, and Charlie


Basically, our own game engine. Hand made and coded using JavaScript, WebGL, and no graphical libraries (though a matrix ones. We may replace it later). 

Starting with rendering basic shapes, eventually this will be a full map, with models, entities, particles, emitters, and other general 3D engine stuff. 

If it works, also gonna have a story.
